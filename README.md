# socmed3dlayeronhover
This is the most recent version of the implementation of 3D layer (isometric) on hover effect for latest social media icons.
Written using just HTML and CSS3, it uses social media icons from fontawesome.
This is intended to be used for Elementor or any WordPress installation, and it works like a charm.
